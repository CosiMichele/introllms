 Google was caught off guard by the release and success of ChatGPT. It has since released their own competitor [BARD](https://bard.google.com/){target=_blank}, which has much of the same functionality as the new [Microsoft Bing](bing.md). 
 
 While BARD [initially stumbled when it was first announced](https://time.com/6254226/alphabet-google-bard-100-billion-ai-error/){target=_blank}, the simple fact remains: Google handles over 85% of the world's search requests. 
 
 Like Microsoft, Google is planning on integrating BARD with their [Google Workspace (Drive, Sheets, Docs, etc.)](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai){target=_blank}.
